The note taker uses Express.js to save and delete user posts. Every new note is assigned a unique ID and then is saved into an array. Not only will all of the current notes be displayed on the left, the user can also view the entire array of note objects by routing to /api/notes. When the user clicks delete, only that post will be deleted and the array of note objects will be updated and displayed again in the db.json file.  </p>

Their initials and score will be kept and shown for reference when they play again.</p>
