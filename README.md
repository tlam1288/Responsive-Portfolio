# Responsive-Portfolio
This portfolio website showcases skills using responsive design using Bootstrap. Responsive design is crucial in web development because we need to ensure that our site works and looks well on all devices. One way to make a site responsive is to use media queries but this portfolio site takes full advantage of BootStrap to do all of the heavy lifting.

Some of the BootStrap components that I used on my site was the NavBar, the grid layout, and the contact form. I was able to use certain class selectors that I implemented into my HTML.

A portfolio site is crucial in getting a developer job as it helps show potential employers the variety of skills it takes to build such a site. I hope to be able to consistently update this site as my skills grow in web development
